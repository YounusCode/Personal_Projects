# Personal_Projects
This repository consists of my personal projects that I have coded in various languages. These projects are the ones that have taken the most of my time and that have taught me the most.

** These Projects are:
- A solitaire game played with a deck of cards that is implemented in Java. It uses ideas from stack and array classes. It does nothing useful, but it is a nice game :).
  - The project consists of the following classes: Card, Deck, Pile, Tableau, and Game. 
- A program that computes Polynomial Arithmetic, it uses linked lists data structure and is implemented in Java with efficiency in mind as it uses singly-linked linear lists and heads. The program runs in O(n) time. 
- An Anagrams project, one of my hardest projects that I have coded. It is a Java program that finds all sets of anagrams in a text file of English words. It uses binary search trees which makes it highly efficent as it runs in linear time.
